# Simple Text Summarizer Web Application

## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly web application that allows users to input any text and receive a concise summary. It utilizes the power of Generative AI through a pre-trained Transformer model to condense information effectively.

## Built With

* **Python:** The primary programming language used.
* **Streamlit:** A Python library for creating interactive web applications.
* **Hugging Face Transformers:** A library providing pre-trained machine learning models for natural language processing.
* **`sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`:** A distilled and efficient Transformer model used for text summarization.

## Usage

You can access the live web application by visiting: https://text-summarizer-app-by-sameer.streamlit.app/

Simply paste or type the text you want to summarize into the provided text area and click the "Summarize" button. The application will then generate a shorter summary of your input.

## Potential Future Enhancements

* Allow users to choose different summarization models.
* Implement options to adjust the desired length of the summary.
* Add functionality to summarize text from URLs.
* Explore different summarization techniques and models for improved performance.
